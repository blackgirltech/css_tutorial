# BGT CSS Tutorial

## Why CSS?

### Cascading Stylesheets
In our [HTML tutorial](https://github.com/blackgirltech/html_tutorial) we learnt that HTML is the bedrock of the web, it's how we're able to see the webpages we do, the web is linked together with a series of HTML files. HTML is the house, CSS is the paint and style. CSS tells the HTML how to look and does this simply by giving the HTML a CSS file.
These documents are called Cascading Stylesheets, or CSS, which is used to style the content of your webpage.

### The Box Model

## First Steps

If you've taken our HTML tutorial, skip straight to [I've Done the HTML Tutorial](#)

### I'm A Complete Newbie
So, let's grab our starter files:

1. [Click here](https://github.com/blackgirltech/css_tutorial) to visit our css tutorial repo
2. Click on the green `Clone or download` button and select `Download ZIP`
3. Open this folder on your computer

The `index.html` file is essentially your website. Open this file in Chrome, Firefox or your web browser of choice. You’ll see it has a few things on it, a header, some links and a few paragraphs but apart from that it's pretty plain. The `index.css` file is where we'll be styling things.

### Text Editor

Next we'll download a text editor for us to write code in. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) suits our needs just fine.

### I've Done the HTML Tutorial

If you've done our HTML tutorial, you can use that same folder.
1. In your __assets__ folder create a new folder called __stylesheets__
2. Open your text editor, Sublime
2. In your __stylesheets__ folder create a new file called _index.css_

## Bonus
Remember those extra pages we linked to in our `navigation`? Try creating those pages so our links work.

Above we're linking to `about.html`, so you can create that file and put it in the same folder as our `index.html`. Try using the tags in different ways to create your pages. You could even research other tags not covered in this tutorial and use those. Check our [HTML Cheatsheet](https://github.com/blackgirltech/cheatsheets/blob/master/html-cheat-sheet.md) for more.
